  abstract: "We propose ResCP, a novel conformal prediction method for time series forecasting. ResCP leverages the efficiency and representation capabilities of Reservoir Computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores at each time step. This allows us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. Moreover, we prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage."

  abstract: "We propose a novel approach to compute the MAXCUT in attributed graphs, i.e., graphs with features associated with nodes and edges. Our approach is robust to the underlying graph topology and is fully differentiable, making it possible to find solutions that jointly optimize the MAXCUT along with other objectives. Based on the obtained MAXCUT partition, we implement a hierarchical graph pooling layer for Graph Neural Networks, which is sparse, differentiable, and particularly suitable for downstream tasks on heterophilic graphs."

- title: "Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling"
  authors: "Ivan Marisca, Cesare Alippi, Filippo Maria Bianchi"
  venue: "ICML 2024"
  figure: "figs/publications/hdtts.png"
  abstract: "Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts."

  authors: "Filippo Maria Bianchi, Veronica Lachi"
  venue: "NeurIPS 2023"
  figure: "figs/publications/expressive.png"
  abstract: "A graph pooling operator can be expressed as the composition of 3 functions: SEL defines how to form the vertices of the coarsened graph; RED computes the vertex features in the coarsened graph; CON computes the edges in the coarsened graphs. In this work we show that if certain conditions are met on the GNN layers before pooling, on the SEL, and on the RED functions, then enough information is preserved in the coarsened graph. In particular, if two graphs are WL-distinguishable, their coarsened versions will also be WL-dinstinguishable."

Compared to other GNNs for clustering, TVGNN creates sharp cluster assignments that better approximate the optimal (in the minimum cut sense) partition. The TVGNN model can also be used to implement graph pooling in a deep GNN architecture for tasks such as graph classification."

  authors: "Andrea Cini, Ivan Marisca, Filippo Maria Bianchi, Cesare Alippi"
  venue: "AAAI 2023"
  figure: "figs/publications/scalable.png"
  abstract: "SGP is novel approach based on an encode-decoder architecture with a training-free spatiotemporal encoding scheme and where the only learned parameters are in the node-level trainable decoder (an MLP). Representations for each point in time and space can be precomputed and the decoder can be trained by sampling uniformly time and space thus gettig rid of the dependency on sequence lenght and graph size for what concerns the computational complexity of the training procedure. The spatiotemporal encoder relies on two modules: 1) a randomized recurrent neural network for encoding sequences and 2) a propagation process through the graph structure exploiting powers of a graph shift operator."
