Welcome to the **Northernmost Graph Machine Learning Group**'s research blog!

Based at the [UiT the Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/) in TromsÃ¸, our group activity is dedicated to basic research in machine learning. 
We also apply our research to a variety of domains, including energy analytics and climate science.

We're excited to launch this blog as a platform to share our journey, insights, and breakthroughs with the broader community.
Alongside the formal presentation in our papers, we aim to complement it here with a format thatâ€™s more relaxed, visual, and hands-on. In addition, we plan to publish tutorials that guide readers through key methods and concepts that we use in our work, making it more approachable to both researchers and practitioners.

## Our Research Focus

Our work spans several exciting areas:

TODO -> add links to papers where possible

- ðŸŽ± **Graph Pooling**: Techniques for down-sampling graph structures while preserving important information ([library](https://torch-geometric-pool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [AB25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05100?), [CB25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09821), [GZB+22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05292));
- ðŸ“Š **Spatiotemporal modeling**: Using graphs to model complex temporal dependencies ([HCB25](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MHQXfiXsr3), [MAB24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10634));
- ðŸŽ¯ **Uncertainty Quantification**: Assessing and mitigating uncertainty in forecasting in both structured and unstructured data domains ([CJM+25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09443), [GSB23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10360823));
- ðŸ”¬ **Interpretability**: Making spatiotemporal models more transparent and trustworthy ([GSB24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13469), [GSS+23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07926));
- âš¡ **Scalability**: Breaking barriers to handle massive real-world datasets ([CMB+23](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25880)).
