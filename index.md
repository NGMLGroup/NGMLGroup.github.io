_Welcome to the homepage of the Northernmost Graph Machine Learning group_

Our research activities focus on Graph Neural Networks and other machine learning methodologies to process and analyze data represented as graph. We are also interested in graph signal processing, network science, graph theory, graph visualization, and other graph-related themes.
We gather regularly to discuss the latest trends in graph machine learning, organize tutorials, workshops, and lectures about our research topics. 

We are located at the [UiT the Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/).

See our [Events page](events.md) for the local events and activities that we organize.

If you are a student looking for a master project or a summer job, have a look at our [student projects](studentprojects.md) page.
