    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        Our research activities focus on Graph Neural Networks and other machine learning methodologies
        to process and analyze data represented as graphs. We are also interested in graph signal processing,
        network science, graph theory, graph visualization, and other graph-related themes. We gather regularly
        to discuss the latest trends in graph machine learning, organize tutorials, workshops, and lectures
        about our research topics.
