From November 25th to 27th, 2025, members of the NGML Group participated in the annual retreat of the [Integreat Centre of Excellence](https://www.integreat.no/) held in Oslo, Norway 🇳🇴. 

The retreat provided an excellent opportunity for researchers and students to connect, share their latest work, and discuss future research directions.

The event featured a series of presentations, poster sessions, collaborative discussiond and group activities. Each group was given a task to work on during the retreat, in which members were asked to actively go in a "safari" among posters to complete their assigned task. The activities were diverse, spanning from analysing research trends withing Integreat, to panel session discussions, to more creative activities such as creating a song related to Integreat on the notes of "Imagine" by John Lennon.

At the poster session, our group presented 4 posters in total, showcasing our recent research.
