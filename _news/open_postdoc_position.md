**Open postdoc position in machine learning for graphs and time series data.**

This is a 2.5-years postdoc position within [RELAY](https://en.uit.no/project/relay), a novel research project led by Filippo Maria Bianchi at UiT the Arctic University of Troms√∏. 
The RELAY project is pioneering the future of energy management by advancing the field of relational deep learning for processing energy-related data represented as time series and graphs.

**Information**

The activities in basic research will focus on:
- Randomized architectures to handle big data
- Multi-scale representations with graph coarsening
- Uncertainty quantification
- Interpretability

The applications will mostly focus on energy analytics: enhanced load forecasting, dynamic power flow optimization, and localization of energy faults on the grid.
