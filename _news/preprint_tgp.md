The new paper "*Torch Geometric Pool: the Pytorch library for pooling in Graph Neural Networks*" by **Filippo Maria Bianchi**, **Carlo Abate**, and **Ivan Marisca** is out!

<!--more-->

We present Torch Geometric Pool (TGP), a PyTorch library that implements a wide variety of graph pooling methods for GNNs. TGP is designed with an easy-to-use API, enabling seamless integration with existing PyTorch Geometric codebases. The library includes implementations of state-of-the-art pooling techniques, along with comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate adoption by the research community.

The preprint is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12642).
