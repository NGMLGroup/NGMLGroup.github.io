We released Torch Geometric Pool (🎱 tgp), the library for pooling in Graph Neural Networks!

<!--more-->

The main features include:

- 📦 Unified API for all pooling operators
- 🧮 18 pooling methods available right now, and more to come
- ⚡️ Significant speed-up thanks to precomputed graph coarsening
- 🧩 Seamless integration with GNNs built in PyG
