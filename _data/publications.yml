  authors: "Andrea Cini, Alexander Jenkins, Danilo Mandic, Cesare Alippi, Filippo Maria Bianchi"
  figure: "figs/publications/corel.png"
  abstract: "We propose a novel conformal prediction method based on graph deep learning. Our method can be applied on top of any time series predictor, can learn the relationships across the time series and, thanks to an adaptive component, can handle non-exchangeable data and nonstationarity in the time series."

- title: "BN-Pool: a Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Graph Pooling"
  authors: "Daniele Castellana, Filippo Maria Bianchi"
  figure: "figs/publications/bnpool.gif"
  abstract: "We introduce BN-Pool, the first clustering-based pooling method for GNNs that adaptively determines the number of supernodes in the pooled graph. 
  This is done by partitioning the graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters using a generative model based on a Bayesian non-parametric framework."

- title: "MaxCutPool: differentiable feature-aware Maxcut for pooling in graph neural networks"
  authors: "Carlo Abate, Filippo Maria Bianchi"
  venue: "ICLR 2025"
  figure: "figs/publications/maxcutpool.png"
  abstract: "We propose a novel approach to compute the MAXCUT in attributed graphs, i.e., graphs with features associated with nodes and edges. Our approach is robust to the underlying graph topology and is fully differentiable, making it possible to find solutions that jointly optimize the MAXCUT along with other objectives. Based on the obtained MAXCUT partition, we implement a hierarchical graph pooling layer for Graph Neural Networks, which is sparse, differentiable, and particularly suitable for downstream tasks on heterophilic graphs."

- title: "Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling"
  authors: "Ivan Marisca, Cesare Alippi, Filippo Maria Bianchi"
  venue: "ICML 2024"
  figure: "figs/publications/hdtts.png"
  abstract: "Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts."
