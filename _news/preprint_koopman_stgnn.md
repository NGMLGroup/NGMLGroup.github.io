"*Interpreting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Koopman Theory*"

By Michele Guerra, Simone Scardapane, and Filippo Maria Bianchi.

<!--more-->

The paper proposes a XAI technique based on Koopman theory to interpret temporal graphs and spatio-temporal GNNs. The proposed approach allows to identify nodes and time steps when relevant events occur. 

The preprint is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13469) and the code on [Github](https://github.com/NGMLGroup/Koopman-TGNN-Interpretability).
