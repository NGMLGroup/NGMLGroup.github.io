The new paper "*On Time Series Clustering with Graph Neural Networks*" by **Jonas Berg Hansen** and co-authors has been accepted on TMLR!

<!--more-->

We study the effectiveness of Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks to perform clustering of time series, whose dependencies are represented by a graph.
