From December 2nd to 6th, 2025, members of the NGML Group attended the [EurIPS 2025 Conference](https://eurips.cc/) held in Copenhagen, Denmark 🇩🇰. 

Join us at EurIPS, a European conference officially endorsed by the globally renowned [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025). EurIPS presents the cutting-edge papers defining the future of AI, alongside a series of independent workshops. The experience begins with the ELLIS UnConference, a kickoff event that invites all participants to join the conversation.

Our group was present with 3 contributions.
