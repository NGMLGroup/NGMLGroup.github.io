The paper "*BN-Pool: a Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Graph Pooling*" by **Daniele Castellana** & **Filippo Maria Bianchi** is out!

<!--more-->

We introduce BN-Pool, the first clustering-based pooling method for GNNs that adaptively determines the number of supernodes in the pooled graph.

The preprint is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09821) and the code on [Github](https://github.com/NGMLGroup/Bayesian-Nonparametric-Graph-Pooling).
