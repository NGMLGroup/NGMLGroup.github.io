**Abtract:** 
Following last year success, we organize the second LoG meetup in Tromsø, on the 27th of November 2024.

[LoG](https://logconference.org/) is an annual research conference that covers areas broadly related to machine learning on graphs and geometry.

It will be a full day of exchanges on graphs and the latest news about learning on graphs. We organize tutorials, discussions and a poster session. See [LoG meetup in Tromsø page]({{ page.webpage }}) for details about the program and for the registration.
