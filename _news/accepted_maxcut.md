The paper "*MaxCutPool: differentiable feature-aware Maxcut for pooling in graph neural networks*" by **Carlo Abate** and **Filippo Maria Bianchi** has been accepted at ICLR 2025!

<!--more-->

The paper proposes a novel approach to compute a MaxCut partition in attributed graphs and can be used to implement pooling in Graph Neural Networks. It works particulary well on heterophilic graphs.

The preprint is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05100) and the code on [Github](https://github.com/NGMLGroup/MaxCutPool).
