## üìù Description
This project focuses on the automatic classification of animal behavior using multi-agent trajectory data. The dataset, the [Caltech Mouse Social Interactions](https://sites.google.com/view/computational-behavior/our-datasets/calms21-dataset) (CalMS21), tracks two mice interacting in the same cage, capturing their movements and social behaviors. The task involves classifying their behavior over time, transforming a multivariate time series of trajectories into a sequence of categorical labels (i.e., a seq-to-seq problem with continuous input and categorical output).

The student will work with the CalMS21 dataset, which includes trajectory data from videos of freely behaving mice in a resident-intruder assay. The goal is to develop a spatio-temporal model using frameworks like [Torch Spatiotemporal](https://torch-spatiotemporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automatically classify behaviors, reducing the need for manual labeling by humans. This approach is both innovative and highly relevant, as manual labeling is currently a time-consuming process requiring significant human effort.

By the end of the project, the student will gain experience in handling multi-agent trajectory data, designing spatio-temporal models, and applying them to real-world behavior classification tasks. The project has broad implications for behavioral neuroscience and related fields, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for analyzing animal interactions.


**Data:** The Caltech Mouse Social Interactions (CalMS21) Dataset, consisting of trajectory data from videos of interacting mice.
